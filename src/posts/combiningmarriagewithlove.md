India – vibrant, diverse and loud – never stops challenging my perspectives. Like when I realized that an arranged marriage in India is just called marriage, whereas a self-choice marriage is called love marriage. I remember a young couple in Bengaluru proudly announcing to me that they had a love marriage. Love marriage is equivalent to the western view on marriage, where the couple’s decision to be together is based on mutual attraction and compatibility. Arranged marriages are decided by parents and other relatives based mostly on religion, caste and socioeconomic background.
Some years after my encounter with the couple in Bengaluru I got to know Surbhi – a woman in her mid-twenties, living in a village called Kanganpur in northern India. In June 2012, at 18 years of age, Surbhi got married to Vincent. A so-called love marriage. It was a rocky road to get there.
