I first came across Daniel Rajcsanyi while researching art students from the art academy in Vienna (Akademie der Bellenden Künste Wien), whom to possibly bring into one of my exhibition projects as a curator in Stockholm. Vienna is a city I could almost call a fourth home at this point in my life and the wish to approach emerging art from there has been with me for a while now. Performance stills from the independent art space School catches my eye on Facebook. Daniel is dressed in a red thong held up by suspenders, with tassels covering his nipples and is found balancing on a hoverboard with an IKEA mirror under his right arm. It’s a compelling sight and somehow fits an idea I’ve entertained about a performance-based exhibition. We get in contact and I eventually learn about his sex work and am then struck by his candor on the matter.  

While the exhibition plan never materializes in a way that allows for Daniel to participate, I end up buying a token artwork from him for my home. It reads “Happy birthday” (not my birthday) and sees him squatting and taking an actual shit in a bowl on the floor. Rest assured it’s one of those artworks that might just have people confused when visiting me. Let’s also say it’s probably the only artwork which for sure would need to be taken down at one of my parents’ surprise visits in the city.
