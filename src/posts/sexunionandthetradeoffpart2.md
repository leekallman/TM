I first come across Daniel Rajcsanyi while researching art students from the art academy in Vienna (Akademie der Bellenden Künste Wien), whom to possibly bring into one of my exhibition projects as a curator in Stockholm. 

Daniel is dressed in a red thong held up by suspenders, with tassels covering his nipples and is found balancing on a hoverboard with an IKEA mirror under his right arm. It’s a compelling sight and somehow fits an idea I’ve entertained about a performance-based exhibition. We get in contact and I eventually learn about his sex work and am then struck by his candor on the matter.
