India – vibrant, diverse, and loud – never stops challenging my perspectives. Like when I realized that an arranged marriage in India is just called marriage, whereas a self-choice marriage is called love marriage. I remember a young couple in Bengaluru proudly announcing to me that they had a love marriage, as if it was something unique and unheard of, as if it required a special effort. I soon learned that that's exactly what it was – unique. India is a vast country, each region has its own culture, so even regarding practices on marriages. But if there is something that all regions have in common, it is the rarity of pure love-marriages.  

Love marriage is equivalent to the western view on marriage, where the couple’s decision to be together is based on mutual attraction and compatibility. Arranged marriages are decided by parents and other relatives based mostly on religion, caste, and socioeconomic background. Usually, there is little contact between the future spouses before the wedding. However, things are changing – more and more young women nowadays have an active role in choosing their husbands, intercaste marriages are more common, the women often get to meet their future husbands before their wedding day. 

Some years after my encounter with the couple in Bengaluru I got to know Surbhi – a woman in her mid-twenties, living in a village called Kanganpur in northern India. Mother of two, Christian, Punjabi. But first and foremost – someone who seemed to have found a way to skillfully navigate the tradition-heavy society she was brought up in. 

India is not easy on its women. Especially when they reach the age when they are supposed to marry. Rather than binding together two individuals, marriage in India is a union between two families. Hence, most marriages are arranged by parents and relatives in all parts of society. In some communities more often than in others. And in some earlier than in others. 
In June 2012, at 18 years of age, Surbhi got married to Vincent. A so-called love marriage. It was a rocky road to get there.
