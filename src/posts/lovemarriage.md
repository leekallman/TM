India – vibrant, diverse, and loud – never stops challenging my perspectives. Like when I realized that an arranged marriage in India is just called marriage, whereas a self-choice marriage is called love marriage. I remember a young couple in Bengaluru proudly announcing to me that they had a love marriage, as if it was something unique and unheard of, as if it required a special effort. I soon learned that that's exactly what it was – unique. India is a vast country, each region has its own culture, so even regarding practices on marriages. But if there is something that all regions have in common, it is the rarity of pure love-marriages.  

Love marriage is equivalent to the western view on marriage, where the couple’s decision to be together is based on mutual attraction and compatibility. Arranged marriages are decided by parents and other relatives based mostly on religion, caste, and socioeconomic background. Usually, there is little contact between the future spouses before the wedding. However, things are changing – more and more young women nowadays have an active role in choosing their husbands, intercaste marriages are more common, the women often get to meet their future husbands before their wedding day.
