Emma has been providing sexual services for almost 15 years. It all started in a popular chatroom, there, she easily got in touch with her first client. Today she has her own professional website, decorated with explicit, yet sophisticated photos of herself. The terms of service are clearly listed, both regarding Emma's fulfillment in addition to what is expected from the client. It is much like you would expect from any other service provider; policies about time/material, travel expenses, and cancellation are brought forth. However, unlike most Sunday night's e-shopping experiences, this one allows you to order not just a casual dinner but a session of anal sex or a threesome as well.

In 2017, she was one of the founders of Fuckförbundet (translating to "the Fuck Union") – a grassroots association by and for sex workers in Sweden.
