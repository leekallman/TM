I am just about to give up on my interview with Emma von Linné. We had initially decided to meet up during a brief stay of hers in Stockholm but ultimately had to reschedule for a telephone interview instead. It appeared that work in Malmö and Gothenburg had come in between on her part. As for a planned photo session, it is left to reschedule for another time in Stockholm. "You have to be flexible", she warns me. Her "dates", as she calls her meetings with clients, always come first. Eventually while by the phone, and as hope is running out by the minute, she finally answers, sounding sleepy in the afternoon. "I was just about to call you", she lets me know.
 
Emma has been providing sexual services for almost 15 years. It all started in a popular chat room, provided by Aftonbladet, still today one of Sweden’s biggest newspapers. She recalls the chat room as being a dark realm where pretty much everything you can think of traded hands. There, she easily got in touch with her first client. Today she has her own professional website, decorated with explicit, yet sophisticated photos of herself. The terms of service are clearly listed, both regarding Emma’s fulfillment in addition to what is expected from the client.
