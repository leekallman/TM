The visual artist and doctorate student, EvaMarie Lindahl, wants us to question the notion that animals (non-human animals) are that different from us. To partake in the exploitation of animals is to support the use of the same mechanisms of oppression at work in the oppression of humans; oppression looks the same regardless of whether the victim is a woman, person of color, disabled person, or animal.

Dissatisfied with how animals are portrayed in historical art – as mere symbols or objects for humans to use – she initiated the interdisciplinary research project “Re-framing the Non-Human Animal in Art Production” where she recreates portraits to give the animals back their personhood. Through her large-scale graphite drawings and text-based performance work, she encourages the audience to question history as they know it and their own relationship with animals.
