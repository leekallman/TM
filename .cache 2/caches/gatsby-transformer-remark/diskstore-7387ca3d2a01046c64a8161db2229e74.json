Each person's participation is hinged on the suppression of any thoughts and feelings about this exploitation – it comes at the cost of denying parts of ourselves. Further, to partake in the exploitation of animals is to support the use of the same mechanisms of oppression at work in the oppression of humans; oppression looks the same regardless of whether the victim is a woman, person of color, disabled person, or animal.
